            <p id="italian">A story of Italian excellence</p>
        </div>
           <p class="pre">
                Minotti is an Italian company with a solid reputation at an international level as
                an excellent expression of “Made in Italy” in the field of contemporary furniture
                   design and ambassador of a classic-modern lifestyle in the residential and
                                         hospitality segments.
                  The company was established in 1948 and born out of the intuition of Alberto
                  Minotti. The small scale artisan workshop grew quickly and, starting from the
                Sixties, became more industrialized in character and size. The next step was taken
                by Renato and Roberto Minotti, who, after the premature death of their father in
                   1991, took over the reins of the company and began a process of growth and
                expansion into the international markets. Responsible for the corporate strategy,
                since 1998 they have shared their creative vision and aesthetic key-principles with
                 the architect Rodolfo Dordoni, who has been assigned the strategic role of Art
                  Director and coordinator of all the company collections. A story of Italian
                excellence also been shared by the third generation: in the forefront, Alessio,
                  Alessandro, Susanna and Leonardo who are facing the challenges of the third
                           millennium, of the digital and multicultural world.


            </p>
            <p class="pre">
                  Central to the Minotti identity is the full expression of the “Made in Italy”
                  concept, which today permanently melds tradition and innovation: the skills of
                 talented artisan are employed to finish a product created by modern technologies,
                 while the intelligence of the hands balances industrial precision with sensitivity
                     and emotion. This high degree of know-how is constantly improved by the
                intensive research on materials and technological solutions thus enhancing the
                  value of impeccable details. The commitment to excellence involves all the
                                                   company.

                   Over the years the company has conceived a specific “Minotti code”, that has
                become a constant feature of every collection, always following the key principle
                 of “innovation in the spirit of continuity”. Deeply rooted in the company's DNA,
                  it is linked to the principles of aesthetic understatement, timeless elegance,
                continuity in the sign of tradition, artisan savoir-faire with great attention to
                                               sartorial details.

               A key role in this process is played by Minotti Studio, heart and mind of the
               company, that encapsulates all the skills of the creative supply chain, from
             architecture to interior design, from prototyping to engineering, from graphics to
              visual, from marketing to communication. Minotti Studio gives shape to designers'
             ideas and projects, channeling their creative energies based on different cultural
             roots, in the development of indoor and outdoor collections for the residential and
             hospitality segments. These collections reflect the Minotti identity as well as the
                                       evolution of living habits.

                    2018 marked a breakthrough in the company’s design management. In
             consideration of the ongoing company growth in the sign of continuity and rigour
                as inspired by Rodolfo Dordoni, Minotti has embraced an exciting creative
            multicultural exchange, thanks to surprising new interpretations by distinguished
            design and architecture professionals, like Christophe Delcourt, Nendo and Marcio
              Kogan / studio mk27, coordinated by the Milanese designer. 2019 marks then the
                        début of the Italian-Danish designers GamFratesi.
             2021 celebrates the debut of a new path that sees Minotti proposing a series of
             furnishings, designed to interpret a new way of living and working, which explore
               study and professional environments, both in the office and at home: Studio
            Collection is born, a selection of meeting tables, writing desks and seats designed
                                  by Marcio Kogan / studio mk27.
               In 2022 the brand explores new creative horizons and welcomes the signature of
                                the Japanese-Danish duo Inoda+Sveje.

               Moreover, in 2022, Minotti gets a prestigious recognition that includes the
                  company into the Special Register of Historic Trademarks of National
             Interest, established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE), to
            enhance the Made in Italy excellences which have been registered for at least fifty
                        years and historically rooted into the territory.
